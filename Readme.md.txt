#Project Name - Adaptive Smart Traffic light System

With the advancement in IoT, there are enough resources to collect Traffic data using sensing devices and image processing systems, various parameters have to be calculated in 
order to estimate the accurate density of a particular type of vehicle in real-time which can be further utilized to formulate an intelligent adaptive traffic control system. 
The proposed system classified the real-time traffic in a lane on road into virtual sub lanes and then allots different traffic lights intervals for different virtual sub lanes. 
Thus, each virtual lane is allotted variable traffic signal intervals based on real-time traffic density of that particular type of vehicle in each virtual lane.
